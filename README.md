# **IMPETUS**: **I**nteractive **M**ulti**P**hysics **E**nvironmen**T** for **U**nified **S**imulations

IMPETUS is an object oriented, easy-to-use, high performance, C++ program for three-dimensional simulations of complex physical systems that can benefit a large variety of research areas, especially in cell mechanics. The program implements cross-communication between locally interacting particles and continuum models residing in the same physical space while a network facilitates long-range particle interactions. Message Passing Interface is used for inter-processor communication for all simulations.

A detailed tutorial for IMPETUS is provided in [TUTORIAL.pdf](TUTORIAL.pdf). Documentation and usage examples are available on the [IMPETUS website](http://engr.uconn.edu/~gelyko/impetus.html).
